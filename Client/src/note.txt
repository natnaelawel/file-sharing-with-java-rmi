What is it?
The application is explained below:

    There is a central indexing server that maintains an index of all the files present on each of the client connected to it.

    There are several clients called as peers which act as both client as well as server

    Whenever a client has to ask for a file, the request goes to the central server which finds the client which has the file.
    The central server, then returns the ip address of the peer which has the required file

    The client then directly connects to the peer which has the file and establishes a connection with it and downloads the file in the shared directory.
